SIH22 Vehicle Registration Plate Detection
The Problem statement is " Moving Vehicle Registration Plate Detection"
The above approach divides the problem into two phases,
1. First we'll use Object Detection to find a Region of interest.
- for OD we'll use Tensorflow and opencv.
2. Then we'll use EasyOCR to extract the text.
